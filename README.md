# Predictions-with-Bayesian
Prediction model for movie rating, using Bayesian modeling

* * *

## Part 1: Data
<p> This concludes 651 observations from the independent movie internet-resources such as Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB, random sampled. 651 movies, which are less than 10% of all movies of the cinematographic era and less than 10% of movies on both web resources. So, because data is got from 2 popular movie resources, we should keep in mind that the prediction model, based on the data from this resources, is applicable to make a prediction for them only. It could not be spread through entire population, except IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes web-site variability of which should be considered in a separate work. </p><br>
<p>During this work we'll use Oscar Season and Summer Season, Drama and Featured film  variables to predict movie popularity (audience_score) applying Bayesian Regression model </p>
